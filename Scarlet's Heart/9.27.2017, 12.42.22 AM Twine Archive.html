I’ve always been questioning myself, who I am, what’s my goal in life, who will I become? 
	I was told that when I was born, I had rearranged organs. I was kept in the hospital for about nine months attached to machines that kept me alive. If I had been born in Vietnam, I would have died leaving my twin sister behind, I was told that story when I was very young. 
	Ever since then, I had thought about what it would be like if I had not existed in this world, what would everyone’s lives would be like? After a year, I had a sister and 4 years later, my little brother. He made my parents happy. They had finally had a boy after having three girls. My little sister had always been the strong one in the family. My brother was given everything that he wanted.
	As a kid, I was very fragile. I was either told I would grow to be useless, or hear that I wouldn’t make it in the real world. My younger sister told me things that hurt me the most, I had grown to hate myself because I had caused my family to pay a lot of money for my life. I absolutely hated myself even till now. At night when I have bad days I would start to cry, then I would remember my reasons for existence.
	At the age of twelve I was still in elementary school. I loved school back then, I remember my first drawing I had recreated of a painting I did in school. I was very proud of it. I brought it to school to show my friends, they said they like it and told me I should become an artist, I was overjoyed, that day I had realized I wanted to be an artist, I smiled more back then than I ever do now.
	[[Chapter 1: My Gentle Goodbye -&gt; Chapter 1: My Gentle Goodbye]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name=" Chapter 1: My Gentle Goodbye" tags="" position="300,200">I thought love was always the same until I met you. Actually, it was weird to get to see you ever day, but then I realized that I didn&#x27;t love you the day I couldn&#x27;t remember why. It&#x27;s sad to lose someone, but you still had to let go till I&#x27;ll find a place where we&#x27;ll meet again.
What I wanted to be best at is to be a good friend or girlfriend for you. Trying to be that is impossible because you never try opening your arms and heart for me.  Is it that I&#x27;m a fool to try to get your heart or is it a past that you can&#x27;t tell.
I try to be what you need and want me to be, but I was never enough for you, do you really know what you were to me? You were the one, the only one I loved. For real, from my true heart.
I always laughed when you laughed and I was sad when you were sad. I watched you to see if you would notice me or if some day.... Some day you would need me.
I cried for you and I would actually try to say I love you in my dreams. You would hug me, hold my hands, say good night every time we go out, and you even kissed me. Most of them were realistic, some were based on fantasy books I&#x27;ve read.
Finding out from your friends that you like me was all, but a dream. They say you liked me. When I try to see if you do, by being nice, you just left me there. So, when I gave up, you would always be there by my side, literally.
True... false... will I fall for you again....
Am I sad you ask? Well I am I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m sad because of love or because of family. My heart aches just thinking, what wrong with me. I don&#x27;t feel bad just sad. Love can really hurt. Like a lot of things say, &quot; a wound on the body can heal, but a wound on the heart can only leave scars…&quot;
Do you still remember the times we were together? Good times, right?
I want to learn more about you, everything I can. I&#x27;ve told u a lot about me and I only know some about you. You never tried to talk about yourself or even asked &quot; wanna get to know me better&quot;? or &quot; what do you want to know about me?&quot;
I believe that you want to tell everything to someone, someone who would sit and just listen to you and to lend a shoulder to you or a hug.
It&#x27;s been a while and I still love you, but I think I found a new love. Someone who would always stay by my side and never leave. He&#x27;s cute, smart, friendly, but he&#x27;s 2 years older than me.
Even though we don&#x27;t say anything we knew what each other felt. We like each other, he knows we can&#x27;t be that close. He keeps me warm and I know he cares. So, I hope this relationship goes better than the old. Sweet dreams…
We talked a lot today and we found out a lot about each other and how we&#x27;re so connected but I don&#x27;t know if he really likes me I&#x27;ll try harder to see if we&#x27;re meant to be.... he makes my heart skip a beat every time we’re close to each other and he would smile when I smiled...when I was sad he would ask why?
I can&#x27;t believe I have a boyfriend now! We have a lot in common, like how we like red (or at least he uses to), black, white. We both like taking things apart and seeing how it works and putting it back together.
[[Chapter 2: I Should&#x27;ve Stopped There-&gt; Chapter 2: I Should&#x27;ve Stopped There]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name=" Chapter 2: I Should&#x27;ve Stopped There" tags="" position="500,201">It all started two year ago, when we had biology together in 7th period. I had a little crush on him.... then he asked my best friend out so i stopped liking him, then they broke up real fast.
This year we have English 11 HN 1st period together.... we got to know each other after a few weeks into the school year. Then one day we were just waiting for Sophia, retaking a quiz or something, with Jason. we went around the school and he asked to go hide away for Jason behind a door and we stayed there for like a 30-minute listening to music and waiting for Jason to find us...still makes me laugh remembering that.... when he finally found us, he asked if Jason wanted to play hide and seek again, he argued a little and then we played again...this time we went to his old Spanish teacher&#x27;s classroom. So, when we were in there I was getting tired and went to sleep.... he sat next to me and we both listened to music while i was sleeping. He showed me what my name meant on Urban Dictionary which was funny so we messaged Sophia on Facebook and waited there for her to come to us.
So, then we met again after school and we hanged out on the stairs near Ms. Inberg&#x27;s Room, I got tired so I kind of fell asleep on his shoulders.... awkward though, but i had a warm and safe feeling that time and i still do now. I felt happy that day.
Then the second time we did the same thing, but that time he put his arms around my waist.......my heart was racing and i was really heating up.... cute time though. Then when it was time to go I showed him a flip book that said I LOVE YOU horizontally and then EM YEU ANH vertically with the &quot;E&quot; from LOVE and EM together. Then he asked for a hug which was a warm and safe feeling too.
Then after that day we were boyfriend and girlfriend, but not officially. We hanged out a lot and did the same things in different orders every day after school. During those times i thought he would kiss me but he didn&#x27;t. So, on xx/xx I took the initiative and kissed him on the cheeks. At that moment, I was hoping he would pull me back but i guess he froze and I was walking too fast.... I wish I could start that day over again.
Then we started to kiss each other whenever we met after school, we would hug, I would sleep on his shoulder and he would put his arms around me. Then I lost my first kiss on October 15, 2013 and it was sweet, but there was still one thing left for us to do to make us true lovers.
I felt like the happiest girlfriend in the world then. I wanted to be able to say the things I felt about him.... tell him I loved him with all my heart and soul. I wanted to be able to call him my boyfriend and call him my true and only lover. I wouldn&#x27;t ever let him go. To live with him my entire life...kiss him every day: kiss him in the morning and kiss him good night. Hug him every day and forever at night. I want to feel my heart race and heat up when he holds my hand and puts his arms around me. I can&#x27;t deny that I love him. I love him.... more than the heat of the sun.... higher than the stars above.........bigger than the galaxy.... the universe.......deeper than the sea floor.... wider than infinity......heavier than a billion things.
I can&#x27;t sleep at night because I don&#x27;t want to dream about him, it&#x27;s because I think the reality of our love is better than a dream. He is the one who finally made my heart whole again. He made me happy every time we would meet eye to eye and when we&#x27;re chatting together. He is the reason why I would always smile every minute of my life when we started.... He is the reason why I can never sleep at night. He got me thinking about him every week, every day of every week, every hour of every day, every minute of every hour, and every sec of every minute. He&#x27;ll never leave my mind as long as i love him....my love for him was for eternity till the second we die.
[[Chapter 3: Remember to Be-&gt; Chapter 3: Remember to Be]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name=" Chapter 3: Remember to Be" tags="" position="700,200">What you should know is that if you ever want to make this relationship last, I learned that you must take chances now, rather than hide, cause if you don’t want to try, you might lose the chance to do anything great. I learned love is not about being perfect, if I can love you for who you are, you should love me the way I am now. Love isn’t about perfection, we will have fights, but you got to let it go sometimes, or tell me it and help me solve it, I don’t like being left alone to solve something. If you want me to understand what you go through, tell me, show me you know what’s right for me, don’t tell me to learn on my own. You want me to be perfect for you, I will, but sometimes there are bumps on the road, when I might not do something right, you’ve got to help me. Relationships are about giving equal opinions, you told me that, and I want to tell you how I feel about things you’ve done, but I can’t because I don’t want to hurt your feelings.
There is this one girl you will love no matter how much pain they put you through, that might be me.
I forgive you for anything thus far, but I don’t forget because I don’t want to get hurt the same way twice and I don’t want to make the same mistake again.
If I wasn’t different, I wouldn’t have been remembered, or if anyone who loved me, would forget me.
I would tell you now, but I feel like you never really broke my heart, you just made it stronger.
All I want is for someone to stay, no matter how hard it is to be with me.
I learned that no matter what it is, I will do anything and everything for you, just to see you smile.
If I keep holding back my feelings because I’m afraid, I’ll end up getting hurt anyway.
We both feel we need someone who deserves us, but we both feel we don’t deserve each other, that why we’re both perfect for each other.
You have given me a lot of pain and because of that I love you even more.
A woman knows that she can do it herself, but only a man won’t let her out.
Don’t take her for granted because one day another man will come along and appreciate what you didn’t.
When I message you, it means I miss you, when I don’t message you, it means I want you to miss me.
If I can give you one thing in life, I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how much you mean to me.

not once in our entire relationship have you said anything besides
1.	Fine
2.	Pretty
3.	Ugly
4.	Ok
NO, YOU DON’T
OUT OF THE ENTIRE ONE YEAR RELATION HAVE YOU EVER SAID IT
YOU DIDNT DO ANYTHING WHATSOEVER TO MAKE ME FEEL GOOD INSIDE AND CONFIDENT IN MY OWN SKIN
EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
I DON’T WANT THAT NOW, I DON’T NEED TO BE CALLED PRETTY OR BEAUTIFUL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
I DON’T CARE ANYMORE DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND BY NOW…. YOU’VE BEEN OTHER GIRLS’ BOYFRIEND BEFORE, WHY DON’T YOU KNOW NOW?? HUH??
you made me think how you felt all the time, what i did wrong, you made me think, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN, why should i do that for you, huh...you gave me meaningless clues to understand what you mean...learn in school, i went to a different school then you, your raised in a different family, your life and your personality, your characteristics is completely different from mine. math, science, all the classes in school has NOTHING to do with feeling, trying to figure a relationship is different from solving a math problem, YEAH YEAH attempt attempt, it won’t help just to think, life is not all about logic, relationships is not logic, it’s about how you feel.
HAHAHA HOPING? IT WOULD WORK? you don’t understand. everything in life is different, from family, school, relationships, and friends; everything you solve in each of those things are different PERIOD.
Don’t you ever dare say that you would die for me PERIOD end of discussion, no complaints.
Don’t let your jealousy go overboard…. jealousy is good in all, but over board is pain too much…. if you repeat the same jealously more than 5x then I’m not going to talk to you.
No more playing…. i don&#x27;t want to play anymore... cuddling sure, hugging is fine, kissing is normal, etc., just no playing, why? because i don’t want to just like you for your touches, that’s how girls are, feeling the sex feeling is normal, that’s how girls react, but if there’s actual love in it too, it’s 10000000x better than just feeling the sex feeling only, after we build the love then we can play again, but for now, no playing.
No random gifts…. i don’t need to receive gifts every day.
I pay for my own food, i pay for myself only...i don&#x27;t need you to pay for me.
ALWAYS DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU TALK TO ME, OR DO IT WHILE YOU TALK TO ME

What:  Seed Collecting:  Rock Run Stream Power Line Meadow
Where:  15033 Lee Hwy, Centerville, VA 20121
Who: Dat: Phuong, Sophie, Ellen and Seraphina - Dayana: Jisu, Leticia and Gabriel

We woke up early to go get something to eat. We got 7 Eleven food. We all met up at school, then we went to the place early, we made it bull run park but that was to u turn back to get to the place. On the way, we saw a big hole. It was a fun day, we raced to see who can get the most seeds It was easy pulling the seeds off its stem, but then after a while it started to hurt our hands, so we got gloves. We made a lot progress and Dat and Jisu got the most. Then Dat and I teamed up and we all headed deeper into the place. Sophie stayed behind. Jisu, Dayana, Ellen, Leticia, and Seraphina teamed up. Dat and I thought it was unfair, so we stopped trying to race and put ours all together except Sophie. Sophie wanted to fill her bag completely (to feel accomplished.) Our bag was really big. Then we found a turtle in the bushes, but it was hiding. I went to show Sophie, but the supervisors told me to put him back where we found him. Then about half way we had a snack break. It was red bean paste stuffed in a flakey bread. It tasted ok, but i gave a half to Sophie. The others were on the other side though so we split up. Then Dat, me and Sophie headed to the car for water (i think) and then talked to the squad a bit. then we went back to where the supervisors were but when we got there, they said we were finished here. so, we had to walk back. After all the paper signing for community service hour we talked about where we wanted to go. Dat, Ellen, Sophie, Seraphina and I wanted to see the big hole up close. Then go to my house for eggrolls. Jisu, Gabriel, Dayana, and Leticia agreed, but when we went out we went straight across the road, and we could because there were no signs. But Dayana went right because she thinks it was wrong. They said they went to Giant instead of following us to see the hole. Then Dat wanted to go see a creek. And we did. But then Dayana&#x27;s car went to school to meet up with us. But because Dat wanted to go see the creek we ended up not meeting up and they left to go drive Leticia to work at target in Mosaics. Dat’s car went to the creek, or Dam we should say, and we went Pedal boat riding. I didn’t want to go because:

1) I wanted to go hangout with the squad
2) I&#x27;m scared of falling into the water
3) I generally didn&#x27;t want to go on the water boat thing

I ended up going on it anyways and I didn&#x27;t like the feeling at all. Dat asked me why, so I said &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go on.&quot; I tried to keep myself from getting angry or sad or make him feel bad, but I did because he could tell and cause Sophie told him. I wanted to stay in the car. So i kept my distance too and walked fast/slower than them. Then we went home and ate eggrolls and I kept my distance from Dat and didn&#x27;t say much. Then I showered and when I was done, he left to drive Ellen home. And we didn&#x27;t talk till late that night.

What: Native Species Planting (170 trees and shrubs) Zachary Taylor Park
Where:  2900 Military Rd
Arlington, VA  22207
Who:
Dat: Phuong, Sophie, Ellen and Seraphina
Dayana: Jisu, Trammy and Gabriel

So today was ok. We woke up and bought coffee with tacos and hotdogs. Then we meet up with them at school. Then on the way there I wasn&#x27;t happy cause I don&#x27;t like the loud music distracting Dat and I go mad and kept quite till we go there. When we got there, we met up with Trammy. We all shared coffee/mocha/hot chocolate except Dat forgot his mocha on the car. Jisu didn&#x27;t like hang&#x27;s coffee because it was too sweet so he drank mine, Gabriel drank with Sophie and Dayana, and Trammy drank Seraphina&#x27;s coffee. I didn’t want to have Dat get mad so I gave the rest to Jisu. We had fun planting trees together. It would be nice if we paired up guy and girl so the girls didn&#x27;t need to do a lot of work, but the girls did their own. Dat and paired up of course and Trammy and hang paired up.

Dat and I: 7 planted
Trammy and Seraphina: ~
Sophie: 4~
Dayana:
Ellen:
Gabriel:
Jisu: 5~

While I was helping Sophie a bit I accidently swallowed a piece of gum &gt;.&lt;. We took pics together and alone I photo bombed Dayana&#x27;s photo though.  Then afterwards we ate snacks, which tasted delicious, and got our paper signed. We got our papers from the car and drove it closer so we can drive out easier, but parking was hard. After we got our papers signed, we discussed about what we should eat. We had an argument about eating out or barbecue at round tree park. I didn&#x27;t like how we can’t go to a final decision. I was unhappy and frustrated so i took the car keys and sat in the car till they finished. I understand that hang and Dat wanted to go barbecuing because it&#x27;s nice to cook food yourself and it&#x27;s cheaper than eating out. But we&#x27;re eating out occasionally so Jisu, Dayana, Sophie, and Ellen wanted to go eat out. The things I didn&#x27;t like was:

Seraphina was being loud so Dayana wasn&#x27;t happy...
Jisu was annoyed (I think) ...
Dayana rolled her eyes because she just wanted to get the bickering over with...
Dat got pissed because it wasn’t going his way...
Ellen thought this was too much work (which i kind of agree) ...
They all or strictly speak to each other which was so depressing for me

Because Seraphina and Dat were so persistent, we ended up going barbecuing at round tree park. We had to go to H-Mart to buy food first and we did, we went separate ways but we met up at H-Mart near Luther. Then Jisu chose the meat with hang and Ellen then left to go to target to buy the extra stuff and to go Gabriel’s house for the coal, tongs, bowl, knife, etc. Dat yells at us (me) because Jisu choose such expensive meet. so we put some back and got other meat that were already seasoned. Then we bought potatoes and other Korean condiments/side dishes. It costed us $70. Dayana&#x27;s team spend $32 and had to drive to Gabriel&#x27;s house to get the other stuff. Then we meet up at the park. We got there first and waited till Dayana&#x27;s team came. We all tried to start the fire for the grill but it didn&#x27;t work so Dat got pissed because &quot;people try to do things they don&#x27;t know how to do&quot; which counteracts with his philosophy &quot;trying to do things is a good way to learn to do things&quot; which he taught me when I should be more &quot;strong&quot; in the family and know how to use the leaf blower at home... Then once the fire finally works we started to cook but the smoke was killing Trammy&#x27;s and Jisu’s eyes, so we fanned the smoke away. We also stood around because it was warmer there and it was fun hangout and cooking with them. Though Dat was still pissed so he sat at the table alone. I left him alone so he could think after I heard what he had to say. Then Dat started lecturing us about how to fan the smoke. When he did it, it got worst... When Sophie and I did it we did well. Then when some of the meat was cooked, we brought it to the table. Then the other meat that was done while we cooked more, we feed each other. Seraphina feed Sophie and Gabriel. Jisu Feed me. It was beef and it tastes cooked. Then we finally chilled down with the whole argument thing and ate as a family which was nice. They said to each other though that they wished they would have eaten out instead of cooking out in the cold outdoors and barbeque next time in the warmer weather. And they all agreed! Then Dayana had to leave to drive her sister home and then come back. Dat and Trammy ate a lot, I didn’t eat a lot cause I wasn’t happy and I thought the pork was dry. Then after we ate Dat drove Trammy and Ellen home, while the rest of us cleaned up. Then we split up what we wanted to bring home. Dayana and I playfully argued about who takes the paper napkins, but then I got the big paper roll and Dayana got the napkins. We thought Dayana, Jisu, and Gabriel left. But they didn&#x27;t. We thought they forgot the wood coal and gas liquid thing so we called and we saw Gabriel. He said they were actually waiting for us :). We all went into Dayana&#x27;s car till Dat got back to pick us up. We talked and it was fun :). Then Dat came back, he wanted to be funny and stayed where Dayana could reverse. Then we waved and Dayana was going to reverse and almost hit the car so it was funny. So, we got home and I showered, and I haven&#x27;t heard from Dat till later that night.

Dat: Sophie, Phuong, Seraphina, Ellen
Dayana: Jisu and Gabriel

So Today Dat had to wake up early to drive his mom to the airport with his family. He made it on time to drive us to the place though. We woke early since today was daylight savings day, we woke up at 8:00ish and go ready, we ate breakfast too. I was texting Dat to see if he wanted to eat a sandwich but he wouldn’t answer or pick up when i called. I wasn’t mad. My dad drove us to school and waited. On the way, Dat called and said he was on his way so I told him to meet at school. We got there first then Ellen. Her grandmother and brother (Kenney) drove him to the school. Then Dat came. Dat came so my dad left after he dropped us off. Dat told me to call where the others are. Dayana said she went to pick up Jisu. Then we all got on the car and waited for the others to come, then i asked him where his community service paper is. He said &quot;Oh shot! I left it at home.&quot; So, we went home to get it. Then he got other food for snacks. Then We left but he remembered that he had his new shoes on so we went back to get it. Then Dayana called and I said were coming. She said she was already there, but when we got there we didn’t see her. So, we waited a bit. Then they came. Jisu asked for the address so i gave it to him. Then off we went. We were right next to each other on Jaguar Trail entering route 495. I wanted to feed Dat a fruit snack but when he ate it he didn’t want it so i took it out of his mouth and ate it, then the people in the back said &quot;ew&quot; then they rolled down the screen and told Dayana and the others. I said it&#x27;s ok cause we’re gf and bf, and talked about how me and grandma kisses mouth to mouth cause i was biting off a small piece of a food for my grandma =_=. they said i was weird. It was weird for me too, i felt a bit out of place and stupid for saying it, then when we entered into route 495 and split up. DJG always goes into the easy route and we took the fastest route. Then when we got there it was a big area but not the same as the place we went at the powerline. It was near a house that looked abandoned. We saw crows on top of the chimney and it spooked us out a bit. DJG came later, Toni, our supervisor was there only. We collected Indian grass while we waited for them to come. Dat, Jisu, and Gabriel came later and helped. Jisu said he didn’t like do this type of stuff. Then Jisu, Sophie, and Seraphina went on the other side. The rest of us stayed where we were. I got closer to Dat cause he wanted to talk while collecting the seeds. Then Jisu, Sophie and Seraphina came back after a bit and said it was wet over there. Then we got into a break and only filled 1/4 of the bag. We ate cookies and candy since it was after Halloween Toni wanted us to at least fill one bag. But after the break only Dayana, Sophie, Ellen, Dat and I continued to collect seed while Gabriel, Jisu and Seraphina just stood there and eat and did nothing. Dat got mad so we tried moving farther from them. Toni found Three dead bodies of deer so I got scared. Then we went back and Toni said to Dat that he should tell our team to motivate them to continue working. But they didn’t listen at first. We continued to collect but there weren’t a lot left so we went to the other side. We found a lot and collected more and then Dat, Jisu, Gabriel, and Seraphina came to help but then after a while Jisu and Gabriel went back. Dat kept telling me how they are bad cause they aren’t helping but eating food that’s supposed to reward us for what we accomplished. Then Grandma called Sophia cause I left my phone in the car. Then Toni said we were done and only ended up getting half a bag. Dat felt bad and said he doesn’t want to control the group if they&#x27;re like that. We headed home.

So, it was like any other morning so we got food to eat and got gasoline, but because Dat was mad, we went there a little late. Gabriel and Ellen got there first and waited. We were going to be late. Dat wasn’t super made when i fed him tacos. When we got there, we waited for Dayana, Jisu and Leticia. Then Leticia came so off we went. We got there pretty quick cause it was a 13-min drive. But DJGL couldn’t find the way cause the GPS wasn’t right. We followed the GPS but I saw the entrance to the park so we went back. Then we got off the car and waited for them. we talked and played and piggy back and carried me. DJGL took too long so we called them but they said they were still on their way. so, we went in. Jisu called Sophie and asked for direction so I took the phone and Dat&#x27;s phone for the GPS. Jisu said this was BS so he wanted to go home. So I helped him but he couldn’t figure out what I meant so Dat took the phone and told him to go to where the GPS told him to go, but then he found where we were. We started to take down some thorny plants and kept the rest that they said was ok. Then they came and Jisu tried to cut a thick tree trunk out of the ground but when he pulled, he let go and flew back, I didn’t see it but Seraphina told me and Sophie and I smiled while Seraphina and Jisu laughed.
