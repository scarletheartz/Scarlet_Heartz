		<h1>Scarlet Heart's Novel</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 5: The Joy of Giving Back</h2>
    <p>When:  October 11, 2015
             <p>9:30 AM - 1:30 PM
<p>What:  Seed Collecting:  Rock Run Stream Power Line Meadow
<p>Where:  15033 Lee Hwy, Centerville, VA 20121
<p>Who: Dat: Phuong, Sophie, Ellen and Seraphina - Dayana: Jisu, Leticia and Gabriel

<p>We woke up early to go get something to eat. We got 7 Eleven food. We all met up at school, then we went to the place early, we made it bull run park but that was to u turn back to get to the place. On the way, we saw a big hole. It was a fun day, we raced to see who can get the most seeds It was easy pulling the seeds off its stem, but then after a while it started to hurt our hands, so we got gloves. We made a lot progress and Dat and Jisu got the most. Then Dat and I teamed up and we all headed deeper into the place. Sophie stayed behind. Jisu, Dayana, Ellen, Leticia, and Seraphina teamed up. Dat and I thought it was unfair, so we stopped trying to race and put ours all together except Sophie. Sophie wanted to fill her bag completely (to feel accomplished.) Our bag was really big. Then we found a turtle in the bushes, but it was hiding. I went to show Sophie, but the supervisors told me to put him back where we found him. Then about half way we had a snack break. It was red bean paste stuffed in a flakey bread. It tasted ok, but i gave a half to Sophie. The others were on the other side though, so we split up. Then Dat, me and Sophie headed to the car for water (i think) and then talked to the squad a bit. then we went back to where the supervisors were but when we got there, they said we were finished here. so, we had to walk back. After all the paper signing for community service hour we talked about where we wanted to go. Dat, Ellen, Sophie, Seraphina and I wanted to see the big hole up close. Then go to my house for eggrolls. Jisu, Gabriel, Dayana, and Leticia agreed, but when we went out we went straight across the road, and we could because there were no signs. But Dayana went right because she thinks it was wrong. They said they went to Giant instead of following us to see the hole. Then Dat wanted to go see a creek. And we did. But then Dayana's car went to school to meet up with us. But because Dat wanted to go see the creek we ended up not meeting up and they left to go drive Leticia to work at target in Mosaics. Dat’s car went to the creek, or Dam we should say, and we went Pedal boat riding. I didn’t want to go because:</p>

<p>1) I wanted to go hangout with the squad </p>
<p>2) I'm scared of falling into the water</p>
<p>3) I generally didn't want to go on the water boat thing</p>

<p>I ended up going on it anyways and I didn't like the feeling at all. Dat asked me why, so I said, "I don't want to go on." I tried to keep myself from getting angry or sad or make him feel bad, but I did because he could tell and because Sophie told him. I wanted to stay in the car. So i kept my distance too and walked fast/slower than them. Then we went home and ate eggrolls and I kept my distance from Dat and didn't say much. Then I showered and when I was done, he left to drive Ellen home. And we didn't talk till late that night.</p>

<p>When:  October 18, 2015</p>
             <p>10:00 AM - 1:00 PM</p>
<p>What: Native Species Planting (170 trees and shrubs) Zachary Taylor Park</p>
<p>Where:  2900 Military Rd</p>
<p>Arlington, VA  22207</p>
<p>Who:</p>
<p>Dat: Phuong, Sophie, Ellen and Seraphina</p>
<p>Dayana: Jisu, Trammy and Gabriel</p>

<p>So today was ok. We woke up and bought coffee with tacos and hotdogs. Then we meet up with them at school. Then on the way there I wasn't happy cause I don't like the loud music distracting Dat and I go mad and kept quite till we go there. When we got there, we met up with Trammy. We all shared coffee/mocha/hot chocolate except Dat forgot his mocha on the car. Jisu didn't like hang's coffee because it was too sweet so he drank mine, Gabriel drank with Sophie and Dayana, and Trammy drank Seraphina's coffee. I didn’t want to have Dat get mad, so I gave the rest to Jisu. We had fun planting trees together. It would be nice if we paired up guy and girl, so the girls didn't need to do a lot of work, but the girls did their own. Dat and paired up of course and Trammy and hang paired up.</p>

<p>Dat and I: 7 planted</p>
<p>Trammy and Seraphina: ~</p>
<p>Sophie: 4~</p>
<p>Dayana:</p>
<p>Ellen:</p>
<p>Gabriel:</p>
<p>Jisu: 5~</p>

<p>While I was helping Sophie a bit I accidently swallowed a piece of gum >.<. We took <a href="plant.jpg">pics</a> together and alone I photo bombed Dayana's photo though.  Then afterwards we ate snacks, which tasted delicious, and got our paper signed. We got our papers from the car and drove it closer, so we can drive out easier, but parking was hard. After we got our papers signed, we discussed about what we should eat. We had an argument about eating out or barbecue at round tree park. I didn't like how we can’t go to a final decision. I was unhappy and frustrated so i took the car keys and sat in the car till they finished. I understand that hang and Dat wanted to go barbecuing because it's nice to cook food yourself and it's cheaper than eating out. But we're eating out occasionally so Jisu, Dayana, Sophie, and Ellen wanted to go eat out. The things I didn't like was:</p>

<p>Seraphina was being loud, so Dayana wasn't happy...</p>
<p>Jisu was annoyed (I think) ...</p>
<p>Dayana rolled her eyes because she just wanted to get the bickering over with...</p>
<p>Dat got pissed because it wasn’t going his way...</p>
<p>Ellen thought this was too much work (which i kind of agree) ...</p>
<p>They all or strictly speak to each other which was so depressing for me</p>

<p>Because Seraphina and Dat were so persistent, we ended up going barbecuing at round tree park. We had to go to H-Mart to buy food first and we did, we went separate ways, but we met up at H-Mart near Luther. Then Jisu chose the meat with hang and Ellen then left to go to target to buy the extra stuff and to go Gabriel’s house for the coal, tongs, bowl, knife, etc. Dat yells at us (me) because Jisu choose such expensive meet. so, we put some back and got other meat that were already seasoned. Then we bought potatoes and other Korean condiments/side dishes. It costed us $70. Dayana's team spend $32 and had to drive to Gabriel's house to get the other stuff. Then we meet up at the park. We got there first and waited till Dayana's team came. We all tried to start the fire for the grill but it didn't work so Dat got pissed because "people try to do things they don't know how to do" which counteracts with his philosophy "trying to do things is a good way to learn to do things" which he taught me when I should be more "strong" in the family and know how to use the leaf blower at home... Then once the fire finally works we started to cook but the smoke was killing Trammy's and Jisu’s eyes, so we fanned the smoke away. We also stood around because it was warmer there and it was fun hangout and cooking with them. Though Dat was still pissed so he sat at the table alone. I left him alone, so he could think after I heard what he had to say. Then Dat started lecturing us about how to fan the smoke. When he did it, it got worst... When Sophie and I did it we did well. Then when some of the meat was cooked, we brought it to the table. Then the other meat that was done while we cooked more, we feed each other. Seraphina feed Sophie and Gabriel. Jisu Feed me. It was beef and it tastes cooked. Then we finally chilled down with the whole argument thing and ate as a family which was nice. They said to each other though that they wished they would have eaten out instead of cooking out in the cold outdoors and barbeque next time in the warmer weather. And they all agreed! Then Dayana had to leave to drive her sister home and then come back. Dat and Trammy ate a lot, I didn’t eat a lot because I wasn’t happy, and I thought the pork was dry. Then after we ate Dat drove Trammy and Ellen home, while the rest of us cleaned up. Then we split up what we wanted to bring home. Dayana and I playfully argued about who takes the paper napkins, but then I got the big paper roll and Dayana got the napkins. We thought Dayana, Jisu, and Gabriel left. But they didn't. We thought they forgot the wood coal and gas liquid thing, so we called, and we saw Gabriel. He said they were actually waiting for us :). We all went into Dayana's car till Dat got back to pick us up. We talked, and it was fun :). Then Dat came back, he wanted to be funny and stayed where Dayana could reverse. Then we waved, and Dayana was going to reverse and almost hit the car, so it was funny. So, we got home, and I showered, and I haven't heard from Dat till later that night.</p>

<p>When: November 1, 2015</p>
<p>           11:00 AM - 1:00 PM</p>
<p>What: Collecting Indian Grass Seeds</p>
<p>Where: 15500 Lee Hwy, Centreville</p>
<p>Who:</p>
<p>Dat: Sophie, Phuong, Seraphina, Ellen</p>
<p>Dayana: Jisu and Gabriel</p>

<p>So Today Dat had to wake up early to drive his mom to the airport with his family. He made it on time to drive us to the place though. We woke early since today was daylight savings day, we woke up at 8:00ish and go ready, we ate breakfast too. I was texting Dat to see if he wanted to eat a sandwich but he wouldn’t answer or pick up when i called. I wasn’t mad. My dad drove us to school and waited. On the way, Dat called and said he was on his way so I told him to meet at school. We got there first then Ellen. Her grandmother and brother (Kenney) drove him to the school. Then Dat came. Dat came so my dad left after he dropped us off. Dat told me to call where the others are. Dayana said she went to pick up Jisu. Then we all got on the car and waited for the others to come, then i asked him where his community service paper is. He said "Oh shot! I left it at home." So, we went home to get it. Then he got other food for snacks. Then We left but he remembered that he had his new shoes on so we went back to get it. Then Dayana called and I said were coming. She said she was already there, but when we got there we didn’t see her. So, we waited a bit. Then they came. Jisu asked for the address so i gave it to him. Then off we went. We were right next to each other on Jaguar Trail entering route 495. I wanted to feed Dat a fruit snack but when he ate it he didn’t want it so i took it out of his mouth and ate it, then the people in the back said "ew" then they rolled down the screen and told Dayana and the others. I said it's ok cause we’re gf and bf, and talked about how me and grandma kisses mouth to mouth cause i was biting off a small piece of a food for my grandma =_=. they said i was weird. It was weird for me too, i felt a bit out of place and stupid for saying it, then when we entered into route 495 and split up. DJG always goes into the easy route and we took the fastest route. Then when we got there it was a big area but not the same as the place we went at the powerline. It was near a house that looked abandoned. We saw crows on top of the chimney and it spooked us out a bit. DJG came later, Toni, our supervisor was there only. We collected Indian grass while we waited for them to come. Dat, Jisu, and Gabriel came later and helped. Jisu said he didn’t like do this type of stuff. Then Jisu, Sophie, and Seraphina went on the other side. The rest of us stayed where we were. I got closer to Dat cause he wanted to talk while collecting the seeds. Then Jisu, Sophie and Seraphina came back after a bit and said it was wet over there. Then we got into a break and only filled 1/4 of the bag. We ate cookies and candy since it was after Halloween Toni wanted us to at least fill one bag. But after the break only Dayana, Sophie, Ellen, Dat and I continued to collect seed while Gabriel, Jisu and Seraphina just stood there and eat and did nothing. Dat got mad so we tried moving farther from them. Toni found Three dead bodies of deer so I got scared. Then we went back and Toni said to Dat that he should tell our team to motivate them to continue working. But they didn’t listen at first. We continued to collect but there weren’t a lot left so we went to the other side. We found a lot and collected more and then Dat, Jisu, Gabriel, and Seraphina came to help but then after a while Jisu and Gabriel went back. Dat kept telling me how they are bad cause they aren’t helping but eating food that’s supposed to reward us for what we accomplished. Then Grandma called Sophia cause I left my phone in the car. Then Toni said we were done and only ended up getting half a bag. Dat felt bad and said he doesn’t want to control the group if they're like that. We headed home.</p>

<p>When: November 8, 2015</p>
<p>           10:00 AM - 1:00 PM
<p>What: Native Species Planting: Rutherford Park</p>
<p>Where: Rutherford Park, Fairfax VA, 22032</p>
<p>Who:</p>
<p>Dat: Sophie Phuong Seraphina Ellen</p>
<p>Dayana: Jisu Gabriel Leticia</p>

<p>So, it was like any other morning so we got food to eat and got gasoline, but because Dat was mad, we went there a little late. Gabriel and Ellen got there first and waited. We were going to be late. Dat wasn’t super made when i fed him tacos. When we got there, we waited for Dayana, Jisu and Leticia. Then Leticia came so off we went. We got there pretty quick cause it was a 13-min drive. But DJGL couldn’t find the way cause the GPS wasn’t right. We followed the GPS but I saw the entrance to the park so we went back. Then we got off the car and waited for them. we talked and played and piggy back and carried me. DJGL took too long so we called them but they said they were still on their way. so, we went in. Jisu called Sophie and asked for direction so I took the phone and Dat's phone for the GPS. Jisu said this was BS so he wanted to go home. So I helped him but he couldn’t figure out what I meant so Dat took the phone and told him to go to where the GPS told him to go, but then he found where we were. We started to take down some thorny plants and kept the rest that they said was ok. Then they came and Jisu tried to cut a thick tree trunk out of the ground but when he pulled, he let go and flew back, I didn’t see it but Seraphina told me and Sophie and I smiled while Seraphina and Jisu laughed.</p>
