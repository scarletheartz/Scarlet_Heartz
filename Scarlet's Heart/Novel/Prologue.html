			Prologue: Far from Being Me
		</h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		I’ve grown to dislike who I am. I’ve always been questioning myself, who I am, what’s my goal in life, who will I become?
		I was told that when I was born, I had rearranged organs. I was kept in the hospital for about nine months attached to machines that kept me alive.
		If had been born in VietAceI would have died leaving my twin sister behind, I was told that story when I was very young.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ever since then, I had thought about what it would be like if I had not existed in this world, what would everyone’s lives would be like? After a year, I had a sister and 4 years later, my little brother. He made my parents happy. They had finally had a boy after having three girls. My little sister had always been the strong one in the family. My brother was given everything that he wanted.

		As a kid, I was very fragile. I was either told I would grow to be useless, or hear that I wouldn’t make it in the real world. My younger sister told me things that hurt me the most, I had grown to hate myself because I had caused my family to pay a lot of money for my life. I absolutely hated myself even till now. At night when I have bad days I would start to cry, then I would remember back to my reasons for existence.

		At the age of twelve I was still in elementary school. I loved school back then, I remember my first drawing I had recreated of a painting I did in school. I was very proud of it. I brought it to school to show my friends, they said they like it and told me I should become an artist, I was overjoyed, that day I had realized I wanted to be an artist, I smiled more back then than I ever do now.
